# ISS-Tracker
Created a Python Program that will email the user when the ISS is over their current location.

The code features commented sections for inputting the user info:
- Option 1: the user can type in their information through the terminal 
- Option 2: the user can hardcode thie information

This program will run every 60 seconds to check if the ISS is over your current location and if it is, it will send an email to the user. 

This program was created utilizing the requests, datetime, smtplib, and time libraries.
